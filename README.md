Data Science Project
A comprehensive data science project encompassing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

This project aims to analyze and model data to derive meaningful insights and predictions. It involves:‚Äã

# workflow >>> mlpipeline


1. Data ingestion 
2. Data validation
3. Data Transforamtion -- featuring engineering, data processing 
4. Model Trainer 
5. Model Evaluation


üóÇÔ∏è Folders
config/
Contains configuration YAMLs:

config.yaml: Project-wide configuration like file paths, parameters, shcema of data. 

logs/
Logs generated during pipeline execution (e.g., run.log) for debugging and auditing.

research/
contains notebooks each stage of the project life cycle. The codes are initially tested over here, made sure there are no errors the ensured everything is running fine and then included in the modular coding. 

src/DataScience/
main pipeline code.  contains modules for:

data_ingestion.py

data_validation.py

data_transformation.py

model_trainer.py

model_evaluation.py


## Key Files

# main.py
Entry point to run the ML pipeline. Coordinates all stages from ingestion to evaluation.

# app.py
Flask or FastAPI app for serving predictions ‚Äî may expose a web API for model inference.

# template.py
Used to auto-generate project scaffolding/templates or code snippets.

# Dockerfile
For containerizing your project ‚Äî makes it easy to run the app anywhere.

# .gitignore
Ensures unnecessary files ( __pycache__, .env) are excluded from Git.

# params.yaml
Holds hyperparameters and settings for different pipeline stages (e.g., split ratios, model settings).

# schema.yaml
Defines expected schema of the input data ‚Äî used for data validation.

# setup.py
Package metadata and setup config if you want to pip-install your project locally or share it as a module.

# requirements.txt
List of Python dependencies for reproducibility.

# README.md
Documentation file describing project objective and structure.
